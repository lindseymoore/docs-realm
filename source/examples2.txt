  * - Project Name 
    - Description
    - Topics
    - Links for Available SDKs

  * - Multiple Realms
    - Use multiple realms to store different types of information. Sync 
      some but not all data.
    - Data Architecture
    - - `Flutter <some-outside-url>`__ 
      - `React Native <some-outside-url>`__

  * - Analytics/Telemetrics Data
    - Take sensor readings, push data to Atlas, and display the results in
      Atlas Charts or a time series collection.
    - Sensors, Atlas Charts
    - - `C++ <some-outside-url>`__
      - `.NET <some-outside-url>`__
      - `Node.js <some-outside-url>`__
      - `Swift <some-outside-url>`__.

  * - Migrate Local to Synced Realm
    - Migrate your non-synced realm app to sync data between devices.
    - Data Architecture
    - - `Node.js <some-outside-url>`__ 
      - `React Native <some-outside-url>`__

  * - Build a ViewModel
    - Separate your business logic from Realm operations for easier testing
      and a cleaner app architecture.
    - App Architecture
    - - `Kotlin <some-outside-url>`__ 

  * - Realm with REST APIs
    - Use Realm for real-time operations together with REST APIs for 
      server-side business logic - all with a single ViewModel.
    - Data Architecture, App Architecture
    - - `.NET <some-outside-url>`__ 

  * - Atlas Search for Mobile Apps
    - Use Atlas Search to find information in remote data without syncing 
      it locally to your mobile app.
    - Atlas Search
    - - `.NET <some-outside-url>`__ 

  * - Large File Storage
    - Store large files, such as images, on a remote server. Use Triggers and
      Functions to store the references.
    - Offline Functionality
    - - `.NET <some-outside-url>`__ 

  * - User's Online State
    - Detect when a user is online or offline. Display an avatar or send
      a notification based on user presence.
    - Offline Functionality
    - - `Kotlin <some-outside-url>`__
