You can save a compacted copy or encrypted copy of a database file 
to another file location with the :java-sdk:`writeCopyTo() <io/realm/Realm.html#writeCopyTo(java.io.File)>`
or :java-sdk:`writeEncryptedCopyTo() <io/realm/Realm.html#writeEncryptedCopyTo(java.io.File,byte%5B%5D>`
methods. The destination file cannot already exist.
