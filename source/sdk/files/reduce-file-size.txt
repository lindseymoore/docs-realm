The size of a realm file is always larger than the total 
size of the objects stored within it. This architecture enables some of 
realm's great performance, concurrency, and safety benefits. 

Realm writes new data within unused space tracked inside a
file. In some situations, unused space may comprise a significant 
portion of a realm file. Realm's default behavior is to automatically 
compact a realm file to prevent it from growing too large. 
You can use manual compaction strategies when 
automatic compaction is not sufficient for your use case 
or you're using a version of the SDK that doesn't have automatic 
compaction.

Automatic Compaction
--------------------

The SDK automatically compacts Realm files in the background by continuously reallocating data 
within the file and removing unused file space. Automatic compaction is sufficient for minimizing the Realm file size 
for most applications. 

Automatic compaction begins when the size of unused space in the file is more than twice the size of user 
data in the file. Automatic compaction only takes place when
the file is not being accessed.

         Use the :cpp-sdk:`should_compact_on_launch() <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
         method on the database configuration to attempt to compact the database. 
         Specify conditions to execute this method, such as:

         - The size of the file on disk
         - How much free space the file contains

         The following example shows setting the conditions to compact a realm if the 
         file is above 100 MB and 50% or less of the space in the realm file is used.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/compact.snippet.compact-database.cpp
            :language: cpp

     - id: csharp
       content: |

         You can configure Realm to check the realm file each time 
         it is opened by specifying a 
         :dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactDelegate <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.ShouldCompactDelegate.html>` 
         in the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.config-compact.cs
            :language: csharp

         If the delegate returns ``true`` -- and the file is not in use -- the realm file 
         is compacted prior to making the instance available.

     - id: dart
       content: |

         You can define a :flutter-sdk:`shouldCompactCallback()
         <realm/LocalConfiguration/shouldCompactCallback.html>` as a property of a
         realm's configuration. You can use this with both local-only and synced realms
         with the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.local() <realm/Configuration/local.html>`
         and :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.flexibleSync() <realm/Configuration/flexibleSync.html>`
         methods, respectively.

         This callback takes two ``int`` values representing the total number of 
         bytes and the used bytes of the realm file on disk. The callback returns 
         a ``bool``. Compaction only occurs if the ``bool`` returns ``true`` and 
         another process is not currently accessing the realm file.

         The most basic usage is to define a file size at which compaction should occur.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/compact_realm_test.snippet.compact-with-callback.dart
            :language: dart

         You can define more complex logic if you need to optimize performance for 
         different use cases. For example, you could set a threshold for compaction
         when a certain percentage of the file size is used.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/compact_realm_test.snippet.compact-with-callback-and-logic.dart
            :language: dart

         builder option when opening the first connection to a realm in your
         Android application.

         .. important:: Compact All Production Applications

            Every production application should implement compacting to 
            periodically reduce realm file size.

         Manual compaction can be used for applications that require stricter 
         management of file size.

         Realm manual compaction works by:

         1. Reading the entire contents of the realm file
         2. Writing the contents to a new file at a different location
         3. Replacing the original file

         If the file contains a lot of data, this can be an expensive operation.

         Use the 
         :cpp-sdk:`should_compact_on_launch() <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
         method on the database configuration to attempt to compact the database. 
         Specify conditions to execute this method, such as:

         - The size of the file on disk
         - How much free space the file contains

         The following example shows setting the conditions to compact a realm if the 
         file is above 100 MB and 50% or less of the space in the realm file is used.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/compact.snippet.compact-database.cpp

         Realm Configuration File
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can configure Realm to check the realm file each time 
         it is opened by specifying a 
         :dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactDelegate <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.ShouldCompactDelegate.html>` 
         in the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.config-compact.cs
            :language: csharp

         If the delegate returns ``true`` -- and the file is not in use -- the realm file 
         is compacted prior to making the instance available.


         Realm.Compact() Method
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without first obtaining an instance 
         to the realm by calling the 
         :dotnet-sdk:`Compact() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Compact_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>`
         method. The following example shows how to do this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.manual-compact.cs
            :language: csharp

         The ``Compact`` method will return true if the operation is successful.

     - id: dart
       content: |

         Realm.compact() Static Method
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can compact a realm file by calling :flutter-sdk:`Realm.compact() 
         <realm/Realm/compact.html>`. This method takes a :flutter-sdk:`Configuration 
         <topics/Configuration-topic.html>` as an argument. When you use this method, 
         the device must have enough free space to make a copy of the realm.

         ``Realm.compact()`` obtains an instance of the realm, and opens it to 
         trigger any schema version upgrades, file format upgrades, migration and 
         initial data callbacks. Upon successfully opening the realm and performing 
         these operations, this method then compacts the realm.

         If successful, a call to ``Realm.compact()`` returns ``true``.

         Do not call this method from inside a transaction. You also cannot compact an 
         open realm.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/compact_realm_test.snippet.compact-static-method.dart
            :language: dart

         .. _flutter-should-compact-callback:

         Conditionally Compact on Open
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can define a :flutter-sdk:`shouldCompactCallback()
         <realm/LocalConfiguration/shouldCompactCallback.html>` as a property of a
         realm's configuration. You can use this with both local-only and synced realms
         with the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.local() <realm/Configuration/local.html>`
         and :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.flexibleSync() <realm/Configuration/flexibleSync.html>`
         methods, respectively.

         This callback takes two ``int`` values representing the total number of 
         bytes and the used bytes of the realm file on disk. The callback returns 
         a ``bool``. Compaction only occurs if the ``bool`` returns ``true`` and 
         another process is not currently accessing the realm file.

         The most basic usage is to define a file size at which compaction should occur.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/compact_realm_test.snippet.compact-with-callback.dart
            :language: dart

         You can define more complex logic if you need to optimize performance for 
         different use cases. For example, you could set a threshold for compaction
         when a certain percentage of the file size is used.

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/compact_realm_test.snippet.compact-with-callback-and-logic.dart

         You can remove unused space by **compacting** the realm file:

         - Manually: call :java-sdk:`compactRealm()
         <io/realm/Realm.html#compactRealm-io.realm.RealmConfiguration->`

         - Automatically: specify the :java-sdk:`compactOnLaunch()
         <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#compactOnLaunch-io.realm.CompactOnLaunchCallback->`
         builder option when opening the first connection to a realm in your

         Realm Configuration File
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can configure Realm to check the realm file each time it is opened
         by specifying a :js-sdk:`shouldCompact <Realm.html#~Configuration>` function
         for the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/compacting.snippet.shouldCompactNode.js
            :language: javascript

         Realm.compact() Method
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Alternatively, you can compact a realm file whenever you'd like by calling
         the :js-sdk:`compact() <Realm.html#compact>` method:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/compacting.snippet.compactNode.js
            :language: javascript

         The ``compact()`` method will return true if the operation is successful.

         Make a Compacted Copy
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can save a compacted (and optionally :ref:`encrypted
         <node-encrypt-a-realm>`) copy of a realm to another file location
         with the :js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo()
         <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>`
         method. The destination file cannot already exist.

         .. important::

            Avoid calling ``writeCopyTo()`` within a :ref:`write transaction
            <node-write-transactions>`. If called within a write transaction, this
            method copies the absolute latest data. This includes any
            **uncommitted** changes you made in the transaction before this
            method call.

         Realm Configuration File
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can configure Realm to compact the realm file each time it is opened
         by setting a callback for the `compactOnLaunch 
         <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-configuration/-shared-builder/compact-on-launch.html>`__ function
         for the configuration. When you call ``compactOnLaunch`` for the 
         configuration, the `DEFAULT_COMPACT_ON_LAUNCH_CALLBACK 
         <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/
         -d-e-f-a-u-l-t_-c-o-m-p-a-c-t_-o-n_-l-a-u-n-c-h_-c-a-l-l-b-a-c-k.html>`__ 
         will trigger if the file is above 50 MB and 50% or more of the space in 
         the realm file is unused. You can specify custom compaction settings 
         when calling ``compactOnLaunch`` depending on your applications needs.
         The following code example shows how to do this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Compacting.snippet.compactOnLaunch.kt
            :language: kotlin

         Realm.compactRealm Method
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without having to open it by calling 
         the `compactRealm <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}
         io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/compact-realm.html>`__ method:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Compacting.snippet.compactRealm.kt
            :language: kotlin

         The ``compactRealm`` method will return true if the operation is successful 
         and false if not.

         .. important::

            `compactRealm <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/compact-realm.html>`__ 
            is not available on Windows (JVM), and will throw a 
            `NotImplementedError <https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-not-implemented-error/>`_ there.

Tips for Manually Compacting a Realm
------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/compaction-tips.rst

These calculations might look like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Set a maxFileSize equal to 20MB in bytes
   const maxFileSize = 20 * 1024 * 1024;

   /* Check for the realm file size to be greater than the max file size, 
    * and the amount of bytes currently used to be less than 50% of the
    * total realm file size */
   return (totalBytes > (double)maxFileSize) &&
      ((double)usedBytes / totalBytes < 0.5);

Experiment with conditions to find the right balance of how often to 
compact realm files in your application.
